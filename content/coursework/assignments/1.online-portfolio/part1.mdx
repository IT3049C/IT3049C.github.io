## Creating the Webpage
0. Open the `index.html` file
    - ü¶â: **Optionally**, open the file in your browser either by path or using VSCode Live Server extension.
1. Where it says `<!-- INCLUDE STYLES FILE HERE -->`, add a `<link>` with a reference to the styles sheet located in `resources/styles/styles.css`.

2. Where it says `<!-- INCLUDE SCRIPTS FILE HERE -->`, add a `<script>` with a reference to the scripts file located in `resources/scripts/index.js`.

3. update the HTML `<title>` tag to be your name.

4. Inside the body of the page and locate the container (`<div>`).
   * ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This container will enclose all of the page's content.

5. Update the `<h1>` to Display displays your name.

6. Add an image `<img>` of yourself.
    * Ensure the images is stored in `resources/images` and that you use relative path, not the complete file path. Remember, I can't access files on your computer (DUHH!).
        * Do

        ```html
            <img src="resources/images/myphoto.jpg" />
        ```

        * Don't do

        ```html
            <img src="C:/Users/yahya/Desktop/OnlinePortfolio/resources/images/myphoto.jpg"/>
        ```

7. üö©  Make a git commit here
    * The commit message needs to be meaningful. Example: *"Initialize the page"*
    * If you're using the command line, the command would be: `git commit -m "initialized the page"`.

8. Create the following 4 sections. For each section:
   * Wrap each section within a `<div>` with a class name of `section` and an ID as specified below.
   * Title each section using `<h2>` tags
   * üö©  make a git commit at the end of creating each section. i.e. `git commit -m "added Personal background section"`, `git commit -m "added Work and Development Experience section"` and so on ...
   * sections are:
        1. **Personal background**
            * The enclosing `<div>` should have a class of `section` and an ID of `personal-background`.
            * Include a paragraph `<p>` or an unordered list `<ul>` with some background information. (don't share too much information, or anything sensitve)
            * üö©  make a git commit `git commit -m "added Personal background section"`.
        2. **Work and Development Experience**
            * The enclosing `<div>` should have a class of `section` and an ID of `experience`.
            * Use an ordered list `<ol>` to list some roles and places you've worked at.
            * üö©  make a git commit.
        3. **Programming Languages**
            * The enclosing `<div>` should have a class of `section` and an ID of `programming-languages`.
            * Use an ordered list `<ol>` to list the programming languages you know.
            * üö©  make a git commit.
        4. **Achievements**
            ** The enclosing `<div>` should have a class of `section` and an ID of `achievements`.
            * Use an unordered list `<ul>` to list some of the achievements you'd like to share.
            * üö©  make a git commit.

9. Style the webpage with some custom styles in `resources/styles/styles.css` using classes, and IDs.
    * The [Bootstrap library](https://getbootstrap.com/) is already included at the top of the HTML file. Feel free to use its classes to style your page.
    * üö©  make a git commit once done with the styling or incrementally as you're making your changes.

10. Once you are finished, make sure you push all the changes to the repository.
    * any thing looking like this or better is accepted. (With content of course)
    <img alt="example image" src={require('./assets/example.png').default} height="400" />
