For 2 points of extra credit, modularize the code into separate files.

Separate the game logic into the `main.js` file and `game.js` file. Such that the game.js file only contains the game logic and the main.js file contains the code that interacts with the DOM and the user input.

The `main.js` file should import the `game.js` file and use the functions exported from the `game.js` file to run the game.
- modify the `script` in the `html` file to import the `main.js` file only as a `module`.
