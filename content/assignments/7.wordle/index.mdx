2. Demonstrate ability to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript.
3. Demonstrate ability to create forms to and handling user input.
4. Demonstrate ability to make network HTTP Requests using Fetch API.
5. Demonstrate understanding of event-oriented programming.

## Guidelines and Tips
* Make a habit of committing and pusing your code frequently to github.
* Make sure to meanignful commit messages that describe what you did.
* Make sure the automated tests and checks (if exists) continue to pass after you make changes.
* **Don't forget to fill out the self assessment on the README file**, and the feedback form at the end of the instructions.

## Instructions
For this assignment you will be building Wordle. Your goal is to build this game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the concepts/techniques covered to-date to build the game completely.

### Game process
If you're not familiar with the game Wordle, it is a popular web-based word puzzle game where players have the task of guessing a five-letter word within six attempts. After each guess, the game provides feedback in the form of colored tiles indicating how accurate the guess was: green for letters that are in the correct position, yellow for letters that are in the word but in the wrong position, and gray for letters that are not in the word at all. This feedback helps players narrow down the possibilities through deduction and pattern recognition. The game refreshes with a new word every day, encouraging players to return regularly to test their vocabulary and problem-solving skills.

This assignment instructions is broken down into multiple parts to complete the game.
- **Part1**: Create the Layout using HTML and CSS.
- **Part2**: Create the Layout dynamically using JavaScript.
- **Part3**: Create the Game Logic and Controllers using JavaScript.
- **Part4**: Replace hard-coded elements of the game with HTTP network requests.
- **Part5**: (not part of the game) Add a dark/mode.

## Grading
1. The application runs with no errors.
2. The user is presented with 3 difficulties to select from.
3. The application can send HTTP requests passing a difficulty level in the query string and able to parse the response.
4. The application obscures the word with underscores of same length as the original word.
5. The application alerts the user if an already guessed letter was guessed again.
6. The application draws the hangman (stick man) on wrong guesses.

## Extra Credit Opportunities
1. Add CSS animation on failed and successful guesses to any of the DOM elements.
