# Setting up the Layout

In this step, we will work on setting up the application layout (Just the look and feel). By the end of this step, we will have a page that looks like this
<img alt="Styled chat messages" src={require('./assets/layout.png').default} style={{width:`50%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>

## Initial Structure
- First we'll create the HTML structure of the page and include the styles and scripts files.
- Update the title of the page to `Wordle`.
- Inside the `body`, create a `header` element with:
  -  an `h1` tag and `Wordle` as the content.
  <!-- -  and a `span` tag with `ðŸŒž/ðŸŒ™` as the content. -->

### Styling it up
- Sometimes the browsers may add some default styles to the page. To avoid that, we can use a CSS reset.
  - We can either use a css library file like `normalize.css` to reset the default styles.
    - Add the following link to the `head` tag of the page.
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/8.0.1/normalize.min.css">
    ```
    - **Or** we can create our own reset styles. I'm going with this option not to over-complicate things.
      - In the `styles.css` file:
        - set the body margin and padding to 0.
        - set the font-family of your liking.
- Set the background color of the body to a dark color (I'm using `#0B1623`).
- Set the color of the text to a light color (I'm using `#F5F8FF`).
- Set the bottom border of the `header` tag to a light color (I'm using `#F5F8FF`).
- Center the `h1` tag in the `header` tag.

## Game Grid
- Now we need to create a `div` with an id of `game` to hold the game's elements.
- Inside the `game` div, we will create a `div` with an id of `wordle-grid` to hold the game's grid.
- The grid consists of 6 rows (or the number of allowed attempts) and 5 columns (or the number of letters in the word).
- Let's create the grid for a single attempt (a row with 5 columns).
  - Inside the `grid` div, create 5 `div` tags with a class of `letter`.
  - Modify the `letter` class styles in the `styles.css` file such that:
    - Set the width and height of the `letter` class to 60px.
    - create some borders for the letter class  the borders of the `letter` class to 2px solid light color (I'm using `#3A3A3C`).
    - We can also enforce a text-transformation to uppercase for the letters.
    - We can set the font-size for the letters `2.4rem`.

    - Center the text in the middle of the `div`

  <summary markdown="span"><strong>ðŸ’° this is my go-to snippet for centering something in html...</strong></summary>

  ```css
    .letter {
      ...
      display: grid;
      place-items: center;
      ...
    }
  ```
</details>

- To Make the grid look like a grid, we can set the `display` property of the `wordle-grid` div to `grid`.
  - We also need to set the tracks of the grid 5 columns.
  - We can set the gap between the columns to 8px. to spread out the letter boxes a bit

  <summary markdown="span"><strong>ðŸ’° check out this snippet</strong></summary>

  ```css
  #wordle-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, auto);
    gap: 8px;
  }
  ```
</details>

- The `div.game` by default, expands to the height of the `div.wordle-grid`. We can set the height of the `div.game` to a fixed value (I'm using 70vh).
  - We can also center the `div.wordle-grid` in the `div.game` using the `display: grid` and `place-items: center` properties.
  - Now, the grid isn't touching the header element


### More Grid Styling
As you know in the game, when a user makes a guess, the game should show the user the result of the guess.
  - It colors the square green-ish if the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
  - It colors the square yellow-ish if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
  - It colors the square gray-ish if the letter is not in the word.

Let's create 3 classes for each of the states:
- `correct` for the green-ish color.
- `misplaced` for the yellow-ish color.
- `incorrect` for the gray-ish color.

to use the exact colors as Wordle, we can use the following colors:
- `#538D4E` for the correct class.
- `#B59F3B` for the misplaced class.
- `#3A3A3C` for the incorrect class.

Assign those classes to some of the letter divs

Now the page should look like this
