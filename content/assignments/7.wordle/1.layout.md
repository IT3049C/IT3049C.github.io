## Overview
In this step, we will work on setting up the application layout (Just the look and feel). By the end of this step, we will have a page that looks like this
<img alt="Styled chat messages" src={require('./assets/layout.png').default} style={{width:`50%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>

Our goal is to have:
- a page that contains a header with the title of the game and a grid that represents the game board.
- The grid consists of 6 rows and 5 columns.
- Each cell in the grid will represent a letter in the word that the user is trying to guess.
- We will also add some styles to some of the cells to resemble the game's behavior when a user makes a guess, and we'll do that using CSS classes.

## Initial Structure
We'll start with the `index.html` file.
- Update the title of the page to `Wordle`.
- Inside the `body`, create a `header` element with:
  -  an `h1` tag and `Wordle` as the content.
- include the `assets/styles/style.css` file in the `head` tag of the page.
- in the bottom of the body element, include the:
  - `assets/scripts/dark-mode-toggle.js` file.
  - `assets/scripts/game.js` file.
  - `assets/scripts/main.js` file.

### Styling the Layout
#### CSS Reset
Sometime, browsers may add some default styles to the page. To get full control over your page styles, we can use a CSS reset.
There are **two ways** to reset the default styles:
  1. We can either use a css library file like `normalize.css` to reset the default styles.
    - Add the following link to the `head` tag of the page (before our own styles are included)
    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/8.0.1/normalize.min.css">
    ```
  2. **Or** we can create our own reset styles. I'm going with this option not to over-complicate things.
      - In the `styles.css` file:
        - set the `body` margin and padding to 0.

#### Now actually styling things
- `body`
  - Set the font-family of your liking.
  - Set the background color of the body to a dark color (I'm using `#0B1623`).
  - Set the color of the text to a light color (I'm using `#F5F8FF`).
- `header`
  - Set the bottom border of the `header` tag to a light color (I'm using `#F5F8FF`).
  - Center the `h1` tag in the `header` tag.

:::tip
ðŸ¦‰: UI/UX best practices recommend that you don't use pure black in your background; Pure black could cause eye strain to users. That's why I'm using different dark/light color pair, feel free to use any other combination

## Game Grid Layout
- Create a `div` with an id of `game` to hold the game's elements.
- Inside the `game` div, create a `div` with an id of `wordle-grid` to hold the game's grid.
  - FYI - The grid consists of 6 rows (or the number of allowed attempts) and 5 columns (or the number of letters in the word).
- Create the grid for a single attempt (a row with 5 columns).
  - Inside the `grid` div, create 5 `div` tags with a class of `letter`.

### Styling the Grid
#### Letter Boxes
- create a style definition for the `letter` class in the `styles.css` file.
- Modify the `letter` class styles in the `styles.css` file as follows:
  - Set the width and height of the `letter` class to `60px`.
  - Create a border for the letter class  the borders of the `letter` class to `2px solid <light color>` (I'm using `#3A3A3C`).
  - Enforce a `text-transformation` of the letters so they are upper-cased.
  - We can set the `font-size` for the letters `2.4rem`.

  - Center the text in the middle of the `div`

#### Game Grid
- To Make the grid look like a grid, we can set the `display` property of the `wordle-grid` div to `grid`.
  - We also need to set the tracks of the grid to 5 columns.
  - We can set the gap between the columns to 8px. to spread out the letter boxes a bit

  <summary markdown="span"><strong>ðŸ’° check out this snippet</strong></summary>

  ```css
  #wordle-grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(5, auto);
    gap: 8px;
  }
  ```
</details>

- Because we're set the columns to repeat 5 times, if you go back to the HTML and add 5 more `div` tags with a class of `letter`, you should see the grid expand to 2 rows.

- The `div.game` by default, expands to the height of the `div.wordle-grid`. We can set the height of the `div.game` to a fixed value (I'm using 70vh).
  - We can also center the `div.wordle-grid` in the `div.game` using the `display: grid` and `place-items: center` properties.
  - Now, the grid isn't touching the header element


### Back to the letter squares
As you know in the game, when a user makes a guess, the game should show the user the result of the guess.
  - It colors the square green-ish if the letter is in the word and in the correct position.
  - It colors the square yellow-ish if the letter is in the word but in the wrong position.
  - It colors the square gray-ish if the letter is not in the word.

Let's create 3 classes for each of the states:
- `correct` for the green-ish color.
- `misplaced` for the yellow-ish color.
- `incorrect` for the gray-ish color.

to use the exact colors as Wordle, we can use the following colors:
- `#538D4E` for the correct class.
- `#B59F3B` for the misplaced class.
- `#3A3A3C` for the incorrect class.

Assign those classes to some of the letter divs

Now the page should look like this

<img alt="Layout Done" src={require('./assets/layout-done.png').default} style={{width:`50%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>
