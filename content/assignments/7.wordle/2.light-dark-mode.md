This is not really part of the game but it's a nice feature to have. We will add a button to toggle between light and dark mode.

- In the `header`, add a `span` tag with `ðŸŒž/ðŸŒ™` as the content.
- Give that span an id of `mode-toggle`.
- Create a new js file called `dark-mode-toggle.js` and include it in the page.
- Add an event listened to the `mode-toggle` span to print a message to the console when clicked.
- Let's modify the event listener to toggle a class `light-mode` on the `body` tag when clicked.
- Define the styles for the `light-mode` class in the `styles.css` file.
- define the colors of the grid cells for when the light mode is active.
  - Background color: `#F5F8FF`
  - Text Color: `#0B1623`
  - Wrong letter color: `#FF4D4D`
  - Misplaced letter color: `#FFCC00`
  - Correct letter color: `#00CC66`
- Define the colors using CSS variables.
