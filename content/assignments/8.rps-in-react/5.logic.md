1. Create a state to manage which View to display. You can use a boolean value to manage this state.
2. pass the stateModifier as a prop to the `WelcomeView` component and use it to update the state when the user clicks the `Start Game` button.
3. Use the state to conditionally render the `WelcomeView` or the `GameView` component.
  - you can use the ternary operator `.. ? .. : ..` to conditionally render the `WelcomeView` or the `GameView` components.

4. Copy over the `RockPaperScissors` class from the previous assignment and import it into the `GameView` component. The `RockPaperScissors` class will be used to handle the game logic and determine the winner of the game.
5. Create different state hooks to manage the game state and the user's choice.
  - userChoice
  - userScore
  - cpuScore
  - gameHistory (an array to store the history of the game)

You will need to update those state values on `Go` click.

This covers the big components of what we need to work on. Use those concepts to finish the game logic.
