For React to capture changes and interactions in the application, it uses a concept called `state`. A state is a JavaScript object that stores a component's dynamic data and determines the component's behavior. When the state of a component changes, the component re-renders.

1. In the `WelcomeView.jsx` file, we need to add a state to store the user's name. We can do this by using the `useState` hook provided by React. The `useState` hook returns a stateful value and a function to update it. The initial value of the state is passed as an argument to the `useState` hook.

```jsx title="src/components/WelcomeView.jsx"
import { useState } from "react";

const WelcomeView = () => {
  const [userName, setUserName] = useState("");

  return (
    <div id="welcome-screen">
      <form id="name-form">
        <div className="form-group">
          <label htmlFor="username">Type your name: </label>
          <input
            value={userName}
            onChange={(e) => {setUserName(e.target.value)}}
            className="form-control"
            type="text"
            id="username"
            name="username"
            required placeholder="Enter Name Here..." minLength="2"
            maxLength="15" />
        </div>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" id="start-game-button" type="button">
          Start Game!
        </button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};
```
