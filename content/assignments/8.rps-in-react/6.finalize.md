## Publishing to GitHub Pages
> There's a bit of different process for publishing a react application to github pages.

- Make sure you select Deploy using GitHub Actions on the repository settings.
- in the `vite.config.js` file, make sure you update the `base` property to the name of your repository.

## Submitting the assignment
On canvas, you need to submit:
1. Link to your GitHub Repository.
2. Link to your hosted GitHub Page.

## Don't Forget to:
* You don't fill out the self-evaluation and self-grading section on the `README.md` file.
* You upload your assignment into GitHub instead of properly using GitHub commits and pushes.
