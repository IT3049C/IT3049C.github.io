This assignment covers concepts and techniques taught in the class so far. Using Git and GitHub, using JavaScript, and manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. The culmination of that, is the first game we build this semester, Rock-Paper-Scissors, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Learning outcomes
1. Convert a web application/game built with Vanilla JS to use React.
2. Demonstrate understanding of the SOLID principle (Single Responsibility) by separating the game logic from the game controller.

## Background
### React
