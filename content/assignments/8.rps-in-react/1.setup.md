To a start a react app, you can use `vite` to create a new react app with the toolings configured for you. Vite is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. You can learn more about that here: [Scaffolding a Vite Project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

In this tutorial, however, we'll be starting from the GitHub repository template provided for you on Canvas through GitHub Classroom. This template contains the necessary files and configurations to get you started with the project.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install the dependencies `npm install`
3. To start the application you can run `npm run dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
  - It may automatically open the app in the browser for you.

4. Navigate to `src/App.js` in VSCode and make some changes to confirm that the app is working and that Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is working as expected.
