1. To start building a react-app, run
  ``` bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  cd my-app
  npm start
  ```
    * you can replace `my-app` with any name you want.

2. Navigate to `src/App.js` and make some changes to confirm that the app works.

:::tip
This is not required, but it is a good idea to rename this file to `App.jsx` to make it clear that it is a React component.
:::

3. If you're using React.js V18, replace the content of the `src/index.js` file with the following:

```js title="src/index.js:
import React from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';


const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>
);

// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
```
  * Not doing so wouldn't affect the correctness of the program, however, you'll be getting some errors in the application console.
