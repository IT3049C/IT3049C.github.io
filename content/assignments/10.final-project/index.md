The Game Hub is a web application that allows users to play multiple games. The Game Hub is a single-page application (SPA) that uses the [React.js](//react.dev) JavaScript Library.

## Guidelines
- As outlined by the syllabus, 30% of your grade in this class will be based on a final project.
- You will need to work in pairs (teams of 2s) for this project.
  - If you'll work on on a team of 3, you'll need to get approval from the instructor and the team will need to do more work.

## Features
- The Game Hub has a landing page that displays a list of games.
- The Games available on Game Hub are:
  - Tic Tac Toe (from React.js Tutorial)
  - Rock Paper Scissors (from previous assignment)
  - Wordle (from previous assignment; you'll need to React-ify this game)
  - One more Game of your choice
    - Or 2 more games if you're working on a team of 3
-
