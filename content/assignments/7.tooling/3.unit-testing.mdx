## Installing Jest

1. Install Jest from npm `npm install --save-dev jest`
   - This step is already done for you as you install dependencies defined in `package.json` by running `npm install ` in the beginning of the lab.

## Configuring

Generally, you wouldn't need a lot of configurations to get started with Jest. But because there are already some unit tests that are already included, and those tests require a bit of configuration, we'll go over some of the configurations that you might need to do.

2. Creat the following configurations
```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  setupFilesAfterEnv: [
    `regenerator-runtime/runtime`,
    `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect`,
  ],
  clearMocks: true,
  testEnvironment: `node`,
  watchPathIgnorePatterns: [`node_modules`],
  testPathIgnorePatterns: [`node_modules`],
};
```

#### About those Configurations

- becuase of how I'm testing the DOM and how I'm using the `@testing-library/dom` and `@testing-library/jest-dom` libraries, I need to add `regenerator-runtime/runtime` and `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` to the `setupFilesAfterEnv` array. This extends the `expect` function to include some useful assertions.
- `clearMocks` is a boolean that tells Jest to clear the mocks after each test. This is useful if you have a lot of mocks and you want to make sure that you don't have any state that's left over from the previous test.
  :::info
  In this lab, I will show you how you can use Mock to mock out the `Math.random()` function.
  :::
- `testEnvironment` is a string that tells Jest what environment to run the tests in. In this case, we're using `node` because we're using Jest in a Node environment.
- `watchPathIgnorePatterns` is an array of strings that tells Jest to ignore any files that match those patterns. This is useful if you have a lot of files and you don't want to run tests on them.
- `testPathIgnorePatterns` is an array of strings that tells Jest to ignore any files that match those patterns. This is useful if you have a lot of files and you don't want to run tests on them.

### Some More Project Configurations

3. Navigate to `tests/0.folderStructure.test.js` file for example. If you had already installed the VSCode ESLint, you'll see that it's flagging some of the built-in jest functions.
  - to fix that, we need to add the Jest env. to the eslint config.

```json title=".eslintrc.json"
{
  "extends": "eslint:recommended",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": "latest",
    "sourceType": "module"
  },
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "es2021": true,
    // highlight-start
    "jest": true
    // highlight-end
  },
  "rules": {
    "array-bracket-spacing": [2, "always"],
    "no-const-assign": 2,
    "no-var": "error",
    "indent": [2, 2],
    "quotes": [2, "backtick"],
    "eqeqeq": "error"
  }
}
```

### Write New Tests
We will be testing the Logic of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, or `RockPaperScissors` class.
* We will be testing the `determinesWinner` and `generateCPUResponse` functions.
4. Create a new file: `tests/3.rock_paper_scissors-logic.test.js` file.
5. on the top, import the Rock Paper Scissors class (now that it's modularized)

```js title="3.rock_paper_scissors-logic.test.js"
const { RockPaperScissors } = require(`../resources/scripts/rock_paper_scissors.js`);

describe(`RockPaperScissors class`, function () {
  describe(`determineWinner()`, function () {
    test(`win cases`, function () {
      const game = new RockPaperScissors();
      expect(game.determineWinner(`rock`, `scissors`)).toBe(`win`);
      // Complete the test
    });

    test(`tie cases`, function () {
      // Write your test here
    });

    test(`lost cases`, function () {
      // Write your test here
    });
  });
});
```

6. Try running the tests using `npm test` and make sure your new tests are passing.

## Improving the Developer Experience with VSCode Extensions
Before we create more tests, let's try to streamline the process of writing and running tests.
7. Install the [VScode Jest Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest). 
  * This will always run the tests in watch mode and show the result of the test in the side bar as well as next to each test.

## Write more tests with Mocks
The `Math.random()` function is a random number generator. It's a function that returns a number between 0 and 1. and the result of it is .. Well, Random!

It's difficuly to test the `generateCPUResponse` function because it uses the `Math.random`, leading to a different response every time. (it's not exactly a pure function).

What we'll try to do here, is to hijack the `Math.random()` function and mock it to return a specific value.

```js title="3.rock_paper_scissors-logic.test.js"
const { RockPaperScissors } = require(`../resources/scripts/rock_paper_scissors.js`);
// highlight-next-line
const mathRandomSpy = jest.spyOn(Math, `random`);


describe(`RockPaperScissors class`, function () {
  describe(`determineWinner()`, function () {
    test(`win cases`, function () {
      const game = new RockPaperScissors();
      expect(game.determineWinner(`rock`, `scissors`)).toBe(`win`);
      // Complete the test
    });

    test(`tie cases`, function () {
      // Write your test here
    });

    test(`lost cases`, function () {
      // Write your test here
    });
  });

  // highlight-start
  describe(`generateCPUResponse()`, function () {
    it(`Math.Random = 0.1 -> Rock`, function() {
      mathRandomSpy.mockImplementation(() => 0.1);
      const game = new RockPaperScissors();
      expect(game.generateCPUResponse()).toBe(`rock`);
    });

    it(`Math.Random = 0.5 -> Paper`, function() {
      // Write your test here
    });

    it(`Math.Random = 0.9 -> Paper`, function() {
      // Write your test here
    });

  });
// highlight-end
});
```
