## Overview
* As you may notice in the `index.html` file, we're importing 2 javascript files `index.js` and `rock_paper_scissors.js`.

```html title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    ...
</head>

<body>
    ...
    <script src="resources/scripts/rock_paper_scissors.js"></script>
    <script src="resources/scripts/index.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```
* In runtime, `index.js` is able to use the `RockPaperScissors` class from `rock_paper_scissors.js` because it's imported before it in `index.html`.
* This is not the best setup. As you lose of the IDE intellisense, and your IDE thinks that RockPaperScissors doesn't not exist.
* To fix this, we can use the `webpack` command line tool. to modularize the code and import one file into the other.
* Finally, we will only import a single script file into `index.html`.

## Installing Webpack
1. Install Webpack from npm.
`npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`

## Modularize existing code
2. Go to `rock_paper_scissors.js` and export the `RockPaperScissors` class using the `export` keyword.

```diff title="rock_paper_scissors.js"
- class RockPaperScissors {
+ export class RockPaperScissors {
    constructor(username) {
        this.username = username;
    }
    ...
```
3. Go to `index.js` and import the `RockPaperScissors` class using the `import` keyword.
```diff title="index.js"
+ import { RockPaperScissors } from './rock_paper_scissors.js';
// Elements
const welcomeScreen = document.getElementById(`welcome-screen`);
const gameScreen = document.getElementById(`game-screen`);
```

## Configuring Webpack
4. Create a new file `webpack.config.js` and copy the following code into it.
```js title="webpack.config.js"
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
    entry: './src/resources/scripts/index.js',
    output: {
        filename: 'main.js',
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    }
};
```
:::danger
I purposely made an error in the above. You should debug when you run `webpack` to see what's wrong.
:::

## Running Webpack
5. Run `npx webpack` to compile the code.
    * a new file named `main.js` will be created in the `dist` folder.
6. We can now replace the 2 script imports in `index.html` with `main.js`.
```diff title="index.html"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    ...
</head>

<body>
    ...
--    <script src="resources/scripts/rock_paper_scissors.js"></script>
--    <script src="resources/scripts/index.js"></script>
++    <script src="dist/main.js"></script>
</body>

</html>
```

:::tip
As a side effect of actually importing and exporting the code, we no longer get the Eslint errors about that.
