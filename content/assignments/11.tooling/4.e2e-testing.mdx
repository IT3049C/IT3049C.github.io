## Installing Cyoress

1. Install Jest from npm `npm install --save-dev cypress`
  - This step is already done for you as you install dependencies defined in `package.json` by running `npm install ` in the beginning of the lab.

## Configuring Cypress
We will keep the default configuration. However to ease the process of starting and running cypress tests, we will add some additional scripts to the `package.json` file.
2. Add the following scripts to the `package.json`.

```json title="package.json"
{
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "cy:open": "cypress open",
    "cy:run": "cypress run"
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

## Starting Cypress
to start cypress tests, run one of the following command in the terminal:
- `npx cypress open`
- `./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`
- `npm run cy:open`

### Write New Tests
When running Cypress for the first time, it create the `cypress` folder with the following folders:
- `cypress.json`` - all Cypress settings
- **`cypress/integration`` - test files (specs)**
- `cypress/fixtures`` - mock data
- `cypress/plugins`` - extending Cypress
- `cypress/support`` - shared commands, utilities

We're only really interested in the `cypress/integration` folder; that's where all tests would be. Let's create a new test file in that folder.
:::note
There should already be some sample test files in the folder, you may opt to leave those in as a reference.
