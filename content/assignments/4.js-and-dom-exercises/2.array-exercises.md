## Instructions
1. Open the array exercises html file in your browser: `exercises/array-exercises/index.html`
    * 🦉: Use Visual Studio Code's `Live Server` extension to open the file in your browser with live reloading.
    * 🦉: You can also run `npm start` to start a local server.
2. Notice how the different input fields are already populated with some input.
   * Although they're only string input, behind the scenes (in the app.js file), they're being split at the `,` and being treated as strings.
   * You may change the input, but make sure you use the same convention.
   * Your tasks here would be provide the correct implementation for the various methods in the `exercises/array-exercises/js/strings.js` file.
