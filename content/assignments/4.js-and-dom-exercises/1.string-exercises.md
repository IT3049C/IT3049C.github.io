1. Open the string exercises html file in your browser: `exercises/string-exercises/index.html`
    * 🦉: Use Visual Studio Code's `Live Server` extension to open the file in your browser with live reloading.
    * 🦉: You can also run `npm start` to start a local server.
2. Type something in the `textarea`; notice how the text is presented back **as is** in the paragraphs underneath.
    * 🦉: Check out `exercises/string-exercises/js/app.js` to see how the methods are being used and how the UI is being manipulated.
3. Provide the correct implementation for the various methods in the `exercises/string-exercises/js/strings.js` file.
    * 🦉: The methods are already defined, you just need to provide the implementation.
    * Notice how the results on the web page change as you implement the methods.
4. To run the automated checks for this assignment, run the following command: `npm run test:unit:string`.
