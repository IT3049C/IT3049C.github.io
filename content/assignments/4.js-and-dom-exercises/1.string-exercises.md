when opening the project in your browser, you will need to navigate to the string exercises assignment page to see the result of your work on the web page.

> These exercises will also help you when working on the JS Exercises Assignment.

## Instructions
1. Open the string exercises html file in your browser: `exercises/string-exercises/index.html`
2. Type something in the `textarea`; notice how the text is presented back **as is ** in the paragraphs underneath.
   * Your tasks here would be provide the correct implementation for the various methods in the `exercises/string-exercises/js/strings.js` file.
3. To run the automated checks for this assignment, run the following command: `npm run test:unit:string`.

Though the web page, only requires you to implement 3 of those methods, the remainder are required to demonstrate your understanding of the JS functions.
AND you'll need it for the JS Exercises assignment any way.
