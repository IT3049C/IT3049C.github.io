This lab builds on the [Rock-Paper-Scissors in React](/assignments/rps-in-react) assignments. In this assignment we start using [React Router](//reactrouter.com/en/main) to create multiple pages. This assignments is also a building block for the final project *(instructions to be posted soon)*. The Game Hub is ultimately going to be a web application that allows users to play multiple games (all built with [React](//react.dev)).

---

## Objectives
- Get more comfortable and familiar with React
- Learn how to use React Router to create multiple pages in a React application

---

## Final Product
The final product for this assignment will be a web application that has a landing page/home page. The landing page will have links to multiple games. Each game will have its own page. The games will be built using React.

For this assignments the games are going to be:
- Rock-Paper-Scissors (already done in the previous assignment)
- Tic-Tac-Toe (you can follow the instructions and the [tutorial on the official React Documentation website](//react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe))
