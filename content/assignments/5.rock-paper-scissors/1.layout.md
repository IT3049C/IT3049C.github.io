## Game Flow
The game flow should be:
1. Web page loads with a form for the user to enter their name.
    * input is required, users cannot proceed without providing their name.
2. After the user submits their name, a new form appears with an input for Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    * You can use:
      * select/dropdown
      * OR buttons
      * clickable text (but why would you do that!)
3. User submits the form with their selection (
    * input is required, they cannot submit it without a selection
4. CPU Player (Behind the scenes), would:
    * generate a (random) response to play against the user.
    * Compare the selections to determine the winner.
    * Keep a log of selections and winners for each round.
6. Web page would display the winner.
7. Show the game log
8. Reset the form after each round
9. User should be able to start a new game.

## Layout Setup
### Structure summary
This tree diagram summarizes the `body` part of the HTML page structure and nesting. Below it, you'll find more details about the different elements.
```
body
â””â”€â”€ div .container
    â”œâ”€â”€ h1
    â”œâ”€â”€ div #welcome-screen
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ form #name-form
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ div
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ label [for="username"]
    â”‚   â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ input #username [name="username"]
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ button #start-game-button

            â”œâ”€â”€ button #go-button
        â””â”€â”€ p #game-history
```
* Change the web page HTML title to *Rock Paper Scissors*
* **Inside** the `<div class="container">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
    * `<h1>` - with a title of *Rock Paper Scissors*.
    * 2 `<div>`s with IDs of `welcome-screen` & `game-screen`.
        * *Tip:* try typing the [emmet abbreviation/shorthand](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets) `#welcome-screen+#game-screen` and hit enter. ðŸ˜‰

    * Inside `<div id="welcome-screen">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
        * `<form>` - with an id of `name-form`
            * `<div>`
                * `<label>` - with:
                    * text of *Your Name*.
                    * [for attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_label_for.asp) of `username`
                * `<input>` - with:
                    * placeholder text of *Enter Name Here...*.
                    * id of `username`
                    * name property of `username`

            * `<button>` - with:
                * the text of *Start Game!*.
                * id of `start-game-button`

    * Inside `<div id="game-screen">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
        * `<div>` - with an id of `score-tally`.
            * `<p>` - with id of `score` and text of `User: 0 v CPU: 0`
                * *Tip:* [Emmet abbreviation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets) for a div with an id of `score-tally` and a paragraph with id of `score` is `#score-tally>p#score`.
        * `<form>` - with an id of `game-form`
            * `<div>`
                * `<label>` - with:
                    * a text of *Select your choice*
                    * [for attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_label_for.asp) of `user-selection`
                * `<select>` - with:
                    * id of `user-selection`
                    * name of `user-selection`
                    * 3 `<option>`s for *Rock*, *Paper*, & *Scissors*
                    * *Tip:* use the [Emmet abbreviation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets): `select#user-selection>option*3`
            * `<button>` - with:
                * the text of `Go!`.
                * id of `go-button`
        * `<p>` - with an id of `game-history`

## Checkpoint
**It should now look like this.**
<img alt="initial look" src={require('./assets/1.png').default} style={{width:`100%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>

*I think We can do a little better.*

## Testing
- to test that your HTML satisfies the requirements, run the tests with `npm run test:layout`. This will run the E2E tests for the layout component only of this assignment.
- You can also run the entire suite of E2E tests using `npm run test:e2e`.
