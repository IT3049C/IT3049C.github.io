## Submitting the assignment

1. update the `README.md` file with the reflection and evaluation.
<!-- 2. Individually as a team, make sure you fill out the team evaluation on [TeamEval](../../../General/team-eval). -->
3. On Canvas, submit the (1) repository link and (2) the hosted github pages link.

## What you need to submit
On canvas, you need to submit:
1. Link to your GitHub Repository.
2. Link to your hosted GitHub Page.


## Grading Criteria
You will be graded using the following criteria.
1. The web page satisfies all the structural and layout requirements.
2. The Rock-Paper-Scissors class contains and satisfies the functional requirements of the game logic.
3. The Web page is hosted on GitHub Pages.
4. Proper usage of git and GitHub and making frequent commits.

## Don't Forget to:

* You upload your assignment into GitHub instead of properly using GitHub commits and pushes.
