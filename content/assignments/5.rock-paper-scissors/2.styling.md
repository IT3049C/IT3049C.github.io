1. Include the Bootstrap CSS styles in the HTML head. [Instructions can be found here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/#css)
    * We don't necessarily need to include the JS Scripts for this assignment - Only include the Bootstrap CSS styles.
    * You will notice the fonts, and some layout aspects of the pages changed a bit. It now look something like this.
    <img alt="With bootstrap" src={require('./assets/2.png').default} style={{width:`100%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>

    *a little better, already*

2. Put a border around the 2 divs;
    * Make sure to include the stylesheet file *below* the bootstrap stylesheet.
    * *Tip:* try typing the Emmet abbreviation: `link:css` then hit enter. VSCode should make the element and you'll only need to change the path.
        <img alt="With bootstrap" src={require('./assets/emmet-linkcss.png').default} style={{width:`100%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>

3. In the styles.css file:
    1. set a `1px solid black;` border for `#welcome-screen`
    2. set a `1px solid red;` border for `#game-screen`

5. Apply Bootstrap classes to the buttons. [Examples on Button Classes can be found here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/buttons/)
    * Set the class attribute of the `Start Game!` button to use the blue `btn btn-primary` style.
    * Set the class attribute of the `Go!` button to use the green `btn btn-success` style.

6. Apply Bootstrap class `custom-select` to select dropdown. [More Info about Bootstrap Select/Dropdown here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/#select-menu)

7. for the `div` immediately below the 2 `form`, give it a class name of `form-group`

8. for the `<input id="username" ...>`, add a class of `form-control`

**It should now look like this.**
<img alt="after styling" src={require('./assets/3.png').default} style={{width:`100%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>

*Not the best look, but it'll do for now*
Let's start building the game logic

## Testing
- to test that satisfied the styling requirements, run the tests with `npm run test:styling`. This will run the E2E tests for the styling component only of this assignment.
- You can also run the entire suite of E2E tests using `npm run test:e2e`.
