No we're ready to provide the correct implementation for the `fetchMessages()` function and the `sendMessages()` function.

## Getting Messages:

1. Update the `fetchMessages()` function to use the `fetch` API to get the messages from the server.
    * You'll need to remove the hardcoded array of images and replace it with a call to the server.
    * URL to the Server is [https://it3049c-chat.fly.dev](https://it3049c-chat.fly.dev)
    * URL to the link to get the messages is [https://it3049c-chat.fly.dev/messages](https://it3049c-chat.fly.dev/messages)
    * sometime, the server might be idle and would take a few minutes to wake up again.

Using Fetch API
<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="fetch" label="with `.then` callbacks">

```js
const serverURL = `https://it3049c-chat.fly.dev/messages`;

function fetchMessages() {
    return fetch(serverURL)
        .then( response => response.json())
}
```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="jquery" label="with async/await">

```js
const serverURL = `https://it3049c-chat.fly.dev/messages`;

function fetchMessages() {
    const response = await fetch(serverURL);
    return response.json();
}
```

    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

</details>

2. Where we're calling `fetchMessages()` in the `updateMessages()`, we need to make sure the function is `async` and we `await` the result from `fetchMessages()`.

<details>
  <summary markdown="span"><strong>ðŸ’° Solution (don't open until you really have to)...</strong></summary>

```js
async function updateMessages() {
    // Fetch Messages
    const messages = await fetchMessages();

    // Loop over the messages. Inside the loop we will
        // get each message
        // format it
        // add it to the chatbox
}
```
</details>
    * try to log the `messages` variable to the console to confirm the structure of each message looks like this

    ```json
    {
        "id": 1,
        "text": "This is my message",
        "timestamp": 1537410673072
    }
    ```
---

3. We need to make sure the function is called at least once when the page loads. We can do this by calling the function at the end of the script.
    * otherwise, we won't see any difference.

```js
updateMessages()
```
---

4. Use `setInterval()` to call this function once every 10 seconds to keep the new messages coming.

    ```js
    setInterval(updateMessages, 10000);
    ```
    * the number `10000` in this scenario is what we refer to as a magic number. it's a value of some significance but someone looking at this may not easily understand what this value is
        * we like to set this value to a variable to make this a bit more readable.
    ```js
    const MILLISECONDS_IN_TEN_SECONDS = 10000;
    setInterval(updateMessages, MILLISECONDS_IN_TEN_SECONDS);
    ```

## Sending Messages
1. Create a send function that would:
    * take the username, and message text as parameter
    * construct a json object with the following properties `sender`, `text`, and `timestamp`
    * send messages to the server here

<details>
  <summary markdown="span"><strong>ðŸ’° Solution (don't open until you really have to)...</strong></summary>


```js
function sendMessages(username, text) {
    const newMessage = {
        sender: username,
        text: text,
        timestamp: new Date()
    }

    fetch (serverURL, {
        method: `POST`,
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(newMessage)
    });
}
```
</details>
